Version 5.1 (released on August 5, 2013)
- supports sparse feature vectors and sparse loss functions
- detects sparse features in text and binary input files
- adds access to single precision accuracy implementations when using the mex function
- adds functions to export or plot the Hasse diagram/factor graph via Matlab
- improves detection of incorrect mex function input 

Version 5.0 (released on June 21, 2013)
- First Public Release
- provides algorithms for inference and learning of structured predictors (with and without latent variables)
- access to algorithms via textual or binary file formats, a mex function for Matlab or directly via C++ libraries
- supports inference and learning with arbitrary Hasse diagrams and factor graphs
- supports arbitrary counting numbers
- considers both shared and distributed memory environments (high performance computing)
- single and double precision accuracy support (not via mex function)
- no dependency besides standard library and MPI for some algorithms

All earlier versions were internal or were used by a restricted set of people.
